## About
Have you ever seen someone tweet something so retarded that you would like a reminder to never listen to their opinion?

Or you vaguely remember someone's pfp or twitter name but not who they are/what they did/why you followed?

<br><br>


This chrome extension solves that by adding a sticky note button to a tweet.

<br>
Clicking the button will open a prompt to write a short note about that account.

<br>
Once you've saved a note for a user, it will show above their account name whenever you see them tweet on your timeline, notifications, etc.
